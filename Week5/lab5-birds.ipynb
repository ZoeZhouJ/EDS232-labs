    "# Lab 5: Species Distribution Modeling with Bagging \n",
    "Climate change and deforestation are accelerating ecosystem degradation, pushing animal species toward the brink of extinction. Understanding the distribution of animals and the factors that influence their ability to thrive in different environments is critical for conservation efforts. By studying these relationships, biological conservationists can develop informed strategies to protect endangered species and maintain biodiversity across diverse ecosystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Species are defined by their behavioral, physiological, and ecological attributes, which shape their roles in ecosystems. In turn, ecosystems and their functions are deeply influenced by the species that inhabit them. This reciprocal relationship makes evaluating species' functional diversity and distributions essential for research in biogeography, community ecology, macroevolution, and conservation. Functional diversity is determined by traits such as diet, foraging strata, trophic level, activity cycle, litter size, generation length, habitat breadth, and body mass. These traits influence an animal’s ability to survive and adapt to different climates, playing a crucial role in ecosystem stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore the connections between animal behaviors, functional traits, and species distributions across different climates."

We covered in lecture how the results of ensemble methods are harder to interpret than a single decision tree.  But we do have some tools to do it.  In this step, we will compute permutation importance, which measures the impact of each trait by shuffling its values and observing the effect on model performance. This will help us identify which functional traits—such as diet, body mass, or habitat breadth—play the biggest role in predicting whether a species is found in a subarid environment.\n",
